        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>Great personalities are not born every day; they are born once in a century and are remembered for
            millennials to come. One such great personality that we will always be proud of is Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam. His
            full name was Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam, born in Rameswaram of Madras Presidency on 15th October
            1931 and died on July 27, 2015, Shillong. He was an Indian Scientist and also a politician leader, who later
            became the 11th President of India. He played an important role in the development of India's missile and
            nuclear weapons program.</p>
            <h3>Career and Achievements</h3>
            <p>
                Kalam's career as a scientist began in earnest in 1965 when he joined the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO).
                In 1969, APJ Abdul Kalam was transferred to the Defence Research and Development Laboratory (DRDL) in Hyderabad, where he worked on the development of India's first satellite launch vehicle (SLV-III).

                Under his leadership, the programme developed five missile systems, including the Agni, Prithvi, Akash, Nag, and Trishul missiles.
                These missiles were significant for India as they gave the country a credible deterrent against its neighbors, particularly Pakistan and China.
                APJ Abdul Kalam was widely recognized as the “Missile Man of India” for his role in developing these missile systems.
                Kalam's contributions to Indian science and technology did not end with the missile programme. APJ Abdul Kalam also played a critical role in the development of India's nuclear program.
                In 1998, India conducted its first nuclear tests under Kalam's guidance, making India a nuclear power....
